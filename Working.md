# Light-weight-image-encryption-using-verilog
This project can breifly explained as an model which will encrypt the image files and decrypt them if we needed.
This as total of 5 modules.
1)Getting the pixel data of images from Matlab by saving them as a text file.
2)Reading the text file of data in verilog and processing the data.
3)Processing the encryption module and storing the data in a file.
4)Reading the encrypted data and decrypt it and storing in a file.
5)Reading the data of encrypted and decrypted files into matlab so we can see the images for verification.

The alogorithm used for encryption is BLES-2. The inverse method of BLES-2 gives us the decryption algorithm.
